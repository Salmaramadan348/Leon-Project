# Leon Agency Website

A digital agency landing page developed using **HTML** and **CSS**, built by converting a PSD web template made by [Graphberry](https://graphberry.com) into a usable and responsive website. It comes in a modern and flat design with vibrant colors. This landing page is great for representing a portfolio for a digital agency. This project has been finished while learning HTML and CSS from [Osama Elzero](https://elzero.org) at [Elzero Web School](https://elzero.org).
